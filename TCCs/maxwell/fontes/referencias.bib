  year = {2013},
  address = {Boston, EUA.},
  abstract = {In this paper we study a resource allocation problem in the context
	of Cloud Computing, where a set of Virtual Machines (VM) has to be
	placed on a set of Physical Machines (PM). Each VM has a given demand
	(e.g. CPU demand), and each PM has a capacity. However, each VM only
	uses a fraction of its demand. The aim is to exploit the difference
	between the demand of the VM and its real utilization of the resources,
	to exploit the capacities of the PMs as much as possible. Moreover,
	the real consumption of the VMs can change over time (while staying
	under its original demand), implying sometimes expensive ''SLA violations'',
	corresponding to some VM's consumption not satisfied because of overloaded
	PMs. Thus, while optimizing the global resource utilization of the
	PMs, it is necessary to ensure that at any moment a VM's need evolves,
	a few number of migrations (moving a VM from PM to PM) is sufficient
	to find a new configuration in which all the VMs' consumptions are
	satisfied. We modelize this problem using a fully dynamic bin packing
	approach and we present an algorithm ensuring a global utilization
	of the resources of 66\%. Moreover, each time a PM is overloaded
	at most one migration is necessary to fall back in a configuration
	with no overloaded PM, and only 3 different PMs are concerned by
	required migrations that may occur to keep the global resource utilization
	correct. This allows the platform to be highly resilient to a great
	number of changes.},

	makes certain well-understood vulnerabilities more significant and
	adds new vulnerabilities. Here, the authors define four indicators

	pool of both physical and virtual servers, connected by a complex
	web of virtual and physical networks. Therefore, to manage everything
	in a data center, system administrators usually need a plethora of
	management tools since one tool often manages only one type of devices.
	The boundaries between the different management tools can limit productivity
	of system administrators on their daily tasks as each tool only offers
	a partial view of the entire managed environment. As a result, advanced
	analytics such as impact analysis and problem determination are generally
	not achievable using the traditional management tools as they require
	a holistic view of the entire data center. In this paper, we describe
	an integrated management system for applications, servers, network
	and storage devices called DataGraph. Our system integrates data
	across heterogeneous point products and agents for management and
	monitoring to enable the above mentioned management analytics capabilities.
	A common data model is introduced to federate data collected by the
	different tools in multiple database repositories so no modifications
	are needed to existing management tools. A common integrated web
	user interface is implemented to facilitate management tasks that
	would otherwise require invoking multiple tools. We deployed this
	tool in a lab environment and demonstrated these analytics capabilities
	through several case studies.},

	The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing
	current and planned computing systems, which require integrating
	several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing
	systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps
	the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems
	that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from
	administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's
	goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes
	itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but
	elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing
	systems.},

	allocated responding to external influences as workload or environmental
	changes. Thereby, workload volatility (WV) is one of the crucial
	factors that influence the quality of suggested allocations. In this
	paper we devise a novel approach for self-adaptive and resource-efficient
	decision-making considering the three conflicting goals of minimizing
	the number of SLA violations, maximizing resource utilization, and
	minimizing the number of necessary time- and energy-consuming reconfiguration
	actions. We propose self-adaptive rule-based knowledge management
	for autonomic VM reconfiguration considering the rapidness of changes
	in the workload, i.e., WV. We introduce a novel WV categorization
	and present cost and volatility based methods for self-tuning. We
	evaluate these methods by a large variety of synthetically generated
	workloads, and by real-world measurements gathered from an image
	rendering application and a scientific workflow for RNA sequencing.
	Evaluation shows that in most cases the self-adaptive approach outperforms
	the static approach.},

	types of concerns originate from the fact that data is stored remotely
	from the customer's location; in fact, it can be stored at any location.
	Security, in particular, is one of the most argued-about issues in
	the cloud computing field; several enterprises look at cloud computing
	warily due to projected security risks. The risks of compromised
	security and privacy may be lower overall, however, with cloud computing
	than they would be if the data were to be stored on individual machines
	instead of in a so - called "cloud" (the network of computers used
	for remote storage and maintenance). Comparison of the benefits and
	risks of cloud computing with those of the status quo are necessary
	for a full evaluation of the viability of cloud computing. Consequently,
	some issues arise that clients need to consider as they contemplate
	moving to cloud computing for their businesses. In this paper I summarize
